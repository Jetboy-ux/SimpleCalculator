My initial thoughts on the SimpleCalculator app were not good to begin with because there were no 
comments in the application. Also, the Main method was at the bottom of the file, which made the code
harder to read. When I modified the application, I noticed there was no error checking. Which assumes 
that the user will never make a mistake, which is not good. As a developer we must handle all use cases, 
we should assume a user has no experience using a computer. The goal is to make the program as user 
friendly as possible all while being functional to. 

Overall, the app was easy to use for me and easy to read after the main method was move to the top. 
The application was simple to begin with. Begin only able to handle an arithmetic operation for only two 
numbers.
